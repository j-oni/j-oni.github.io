				<p><strong>Bob Dylan ( born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941)</strong> is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements.</p>
				<p>Dylan's lyrics incorporate a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture.	In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. In 2016, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition".</p>

				<p> Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution.</p>
				<p>	Since 1994, Dylan has published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power."</p>

				<h2><a href="#1">Like a Rolling Stone</a></h2>
				<p>
					Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
					Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?<br>
					People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'<br>
					You thought they were all kidding you<br>
					You used to laugh about<br>
					Everybody that was hanging out<br>
					Now you don't talk so loud<br>
					Now you don't seem so proud<br>
					About having to be scrounging your next meal<br>
					<br>
					How does it feel, how does it feel?<br>
					To be without a home<br>
					Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone<br>
					<br>
					Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely<br>
					But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
					Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street<br>
					And now you're gonna have to get used to it<br>
					You say you never compromise<br>
					With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
					He's not selling any alibis<br>
					As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
					And say do you want to make a deal?<br>
					<br>
					How does it feel, how does it feel?<br>
					To be on your own, with no direction home<br>
					A complete unknown, like a rolling stone<br>
					<br>
					Ah you never turned around to see the frowns<br>
					On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you<br>
					You never understood that it ain't no good<br>
					You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you<br>
					You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat<br>
					Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br>
					Ain't it hard when you discovered that<br>
					He really wasn't where it's at<br>
					After he took from you everything he could steal<br>
					<br>
					How does it feel, how does it feel?<br>
					To have on your own, with no direction home<br>
					Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone<br>
					<br>
					Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people<br>
					They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made<br>
					Exchanging all precious gifts<br>
					But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe<br>
					You used to be so amused<br>
					At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>
					Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse<br>
					When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br>
					You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal<br>
					<br>
					How does it feel, ah how does it feel?<br>
					To be on your own, with no direction home<br>
					Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

				<h2><a href="#1">A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall</a></h2>
				<p>
					Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son<br>
					And where have you been, my darling young one<br>
					I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains<br>
					I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways<br>
					I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests<br>
					I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br>
					I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard<br>
					And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard<br>
					It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br>
					<br>
					Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son<br>
					And what did you see, my darling young one<br>
					I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it<br>
					I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it<br>
					I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'<br>
					I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'<br>
					I saw a white ladder all covered with water<br>
					I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken<br>
					I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children<br>
					And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br>
					It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br>
					<br>
					And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br>
					And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br>
					I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin'<br>
					Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world<br>
					Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'<br>
					Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'<br>
					Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'<br>
					Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter<br>
					Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley<br>
					And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br>
					It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br>
					<br>
					Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?<br>
					Who did you meet, my darling young one?<br>
					I met a young child beside a dead pony<br>
					I met a white man who walked a black dog<br>
					I met a young woman whose body was burning<br>
					I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow<br>
					I met one man who was wounded in love<br>
					I met another man who was wounded with hatred<br>
					And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br>
					It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br>
					<br>
					And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br>
					And what'll you do now, my darling young one?<br>
					I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'<br>
					I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest<br>
					Where the people are many and their hands are all empty<br>
					Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters<br>
					Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison<br>
					And the executioner's face is always well hidden<br>
					Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten<br>
					Where black is the color, where none is the number<br>
					And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it<br>
					And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it<br>
					Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'<br>
					But I'll know my song well before I start singin'<br>
					And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br>
					It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

				<h2><a href="#1">Tangled Up in Blue</a></h2>
				<p>
					Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'<br>
					I was layin' in bed<br>
					Wondrin' if she'd changed at all<br>
					If her hair was still red<br>
					Her folks they said our lives together<br>
					Sure was gonna be rough<br>
					They never did like<br>
					Mama's homemade dress<br>
					Papa's bank book wasn't big enough<br>
					And I was standin' on the side of the road<br>
					Rain fallin' on my shoes<br>
					Heading out for the east coast<br>
					Lord knows I've paid some dues<br>
					Gettin' through<br>
					Tangled up in blue<br>
					<br>
					She was married when we first met<br>
					Soon to be divorced<br>
					I helped her out of a jam I guess<br>
					But I used a little too much force<br>
					We drove that car as far as we could<br>
					Abandoned it out west<br>
					Split up on a dark sad night<br>
					Both agreeing it was best<br>
					She turned around to look at me<br>
					As I was walkin' away<br>
					I heard her say over my shoulder<br>
					We'll meet again some day<br>
					On the avenue<br>
					Tangled up in blue<br>
					<br>
					I had a job in the great north woods<br>
					Working as a cook for a spell<br>
					But I never did like it all that much<br>
					And one day the axe just fell<br>
					So I drifted down to New Orleans<br>
					Where I was looking for to be employed<br>
					Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat<br>
					Right outside of Delacroix<br>
					But all the while I was alone<br>
					The past was close behind<br>
					I seen a lot of women<br>
					But she never escaped my mind<br>
					And I just grew<br>
					Tangled up in blue<br>
					<br>
					She was workin' in a topless place<br>
					And I stopped in for a beer<br>
					I just kept lookin' at the side of her face<br>
					In the spotlight so clear<br>
					And later on as the crowd thinned out<br>
					I's just about to do the same<br>
					She was standing there in back of my chair<br>
					Said to me, Don't I know your name?<br>
					I muttered somethin' under my breath<br>
					She studied the lines on my face<br>
					I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br>
					When she bent down to tie the laces<br>
					Of my shoe<br>
					Tangled up in blue<br>
					<br>
					She lit a burner on the stove<br>
					And offered me a pipe<br>
					I thought you'd never say hello, she said<br>
					You look like the silent type<br>
					Then she opened up a book of poems<br>
					And handed it to me<br>
					Written by an Italian poet<br>
					From the thirteenth century<br>
					And everyone of them words rang true<br>
					And glowed like burnin' coal<br>
					Pourin' off of every page<br>
					Like it was written in my soul<br>
					From me to you<br>
					Tangled up in blue<br>
					<br>
					I lived with them on Montague Street<br>
					In a basement down the stairs<br>
					There was music in the cafes at night<br>
					And revolution in the air<br>
					Then he started into dealing with slaves<br>
					And something inside of him died<br>
					She had to sell everything she owned<br>
					And froze up inside<br>
					And when finally the bottom fell out<br>
					I became withdrawn<br>
					The only thing I knew how to do<br>
					Was to keep on keepin' on<br>
					Like a bird that flew<br>
					Tangled up in blue<br>
					<br>
					So now I'm goin' back again<br>
					I got to get to her somehow<br>
					All the people we used to know<br>
					They're an illusion to me now<br>
					Some are mathematicians<br>
					Some are carpenters' wives<br>
					Don't know how it all got started<br>
					I don't know what they're doin' with their lives<br>
					But me, I'm still on the road<br>
					Headin' for another joint<br>
					We always did feel the same<br>
					We just saw it from a different point<br>
					Of view<br>
					Tangled up in blue
