				<h2>Hallelujah</h2>
				<p>
					Now, I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
					That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br>
					But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
					It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth<br>
					The minor fall, the major lift<br>
					The baffled king composing hallelujah
				</p>
				<p>
					Hallelujah x4
				</p>
				<p>
					Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
					You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
					Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya<br>
					She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
					She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br>
					And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
				</p>
				<p>
					Hallelujah x4
				</p>
				<p>
					You say I took the name in vain<br>
					I don't even know the name<br>
					But if I did, well really, what's it to you?<br>
					There's a blaze of light in every word<br>
					It doesn't matter which you heard<br>
					The holy or the broken hallelujah
				</p>
				<p>
					Hallelujah x4
				</p>
				<p>
					I did my best, it wasn't much<br>
					I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch<br>
					I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you<br>
					And even though it all went wrong<br>
					I'll stand before the lord of song<br>
					With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
				</p>
				<p>
					Hallelujah x18
